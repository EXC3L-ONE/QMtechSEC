# QMtechSEC resources

## Online courses
- [Cybrary.it](https://cybrary.it/) is a good one especially the [Security+](https://www.cybrary.it/course/comptia-security-plus/) and [Advanced Penetration Testing](https://www.cybrary.it/course/advanced-penetration-testing/) courses. You can also find a lot shorter courses that cover the basics of cyber security. 
- [ImmersiveLabs](https://dca.immersivelabs.online/) is a web-based training platform that has both theoretical and practical labs. In my opinion it's a great place to 'get your feet wet' and get a glimpse of security. Remember to register with your uni email to get free access. 
- [O'Reilley](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/) is another great source where you can find a lot of books and courses on security. You can register with your university email to get free access [here](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/temporary-access/?orpq).
- [MalwareUnicorn reverse engineering workshops](https://malwareunicorn.org/#/) is a website that allows you to learn reverse engineering. This is more advanced, so I wouldn't start out with this one. 

## Practical learning
If you want to (and believe me, you should) learn via practise, not just books, here are a few things to get you started:

- [Kali Linux](https://kali.org/) is a pen testing linux distribution that is the cornerstone of learning ethical hacking. To run it you need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). If you don't know how to install Kali on VirtualBox just Google it, there are a ton of good guides. 
- [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu/) is a cloud based pentesting lab that has a lot of vulnerable machines that you can use to hone your skills. If you don't know which 'boxes' are worthwhile check out [this page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#). My word of recommendation also goes to [ippsec and his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA), where he's uploading walk-throughs to all the (retired) machines from HTB. 
- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) is similar to HTB, but instead of having the target machine in the cloud, you download it and run it in VirtualBox. 
- [root-me.org](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en) is simillar to HTB (meaning it's also cloud based), but is based around challenges, rather than full virtual machines.
- [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/) is a good place to find applications for practising reverse engineering. 

## Podcasts
Since we all commute and spend (waste) a lot of time doing so, a great way to learn on the go are podcasts. Here are my top recommendations:

- [Hackable?](https://hackablepodcast.com/) [[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/77s2POytwHIUGHZHKS01Ct?si=4gE6uHEERKCXDC4P-hNk3A)] is a podcast covering all things security.
- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) [[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4XPl3uEEL9hvqMkoZrzbx5?si=QKLxc01_TyaK82a1QS1Dbg5)] is also very broad in terms of topics, but focuses more on more real high-profile attacks from all around the world. 
- [Malicious Life](https://malicious.life/) [[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1KHIsaZ9mX0NbzPrfId00q?si=TDmk8Ff_S7qVKBOoZXj99A)] tells real stories from the cyber security world. 
- [Hacking Humans](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/hacking-humans.html)[[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1KHIsaZ9mX0NbzPrfId00q?si=J9MEDhigQVKV070gYC3-Aw)] focuses on social engineering scams and tricks that modern criminals are using. 
- [Internet Storm Center Stormcast](https://isc.sans.edu/podcast.html) [[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4orGHEysjCAWvGEbHzeL9A?si=fzPpIVvwTWKR0UwWwWe4yA)] is a short (under 10 minute) daily news source.
- [Smashing Security](https://www.smashingsecurity.com/) [[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3J7pBxEu43nCnRTSXaan8S?si=vB6VrBNMQrKfH6pyiedZog)] is a more relaxed, fun podcast that takes all the essential information from the past week and presents it in a less-serious fashion. 

## Books
- [Security+ Course Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CompTIA-Security-Get-Certified-Ahead/dp/1939136059/) is a great book covering all basic concepts in cybersec. It is meant to prepare you for the [CompTia Security+ certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) (which I recommend), but can also be used as a general learning resource. 
- [Sandworm by Andy Greenberg](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sandworm-Cyberwar-Kremlins-Dangerous-Hackers/dp/0385544405/) is a very recent book covering one of the most dangerous APT groups in the world. While it focuses heavily on the geo-political aspect of their operation, I still think it's a good read if you're serious about security. 
- [RTFM (Red Team Field Manual)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rtfm-Red-Team-Field-Manual/dp/1494295504/) is not a 'normal' book but rather (an incredibily useful) manual of the most essential offensive security commands. 

## Other learning resources
- [This security news aggregator](https://security.didici.cc/news) is here you will find all the latest news from numerous websites. You can also use apps such as [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) to make your own news feed that you can scroll through every morning. 
- [This tweeter list](https://twitter.com/Zloool/lists/g-hackers) is also a good place to find news from the offensive security world, though I would recommend using it as a starting point in your twitter journey and not the sole information source. 
- You can also find a lot of great articles and stories related to security [Medium](https://medium.com). I recommend setting up an account and turning on the 'Daily Digest' feature that will send you a list of curated stories (related to your chosen topics) every morning. 
- YouTube channels featuring talks from conferences such as [DEFCON](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference) or [BlackHat](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackHatOfficialYT) also have a lot of good content. 
- If you want to learn about TTP's (tactics, techniques and procedures) that modern adverseries are using check out the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)

## Tools

- I covered the most essential tools during my 'Hacking Tools of Trade' presentation. You can find the slides (with all the links) in the WhatsApp chat. 
- If you want more tools however, check out the [Red Teaming Toolkit](https://github.com/infosecn1nja/Red-Teaming-Toolkit).
- Also remember that Kali has a [website](https://tools.kali.org/) covering all the tools (and their usage) included in Kali. 

## Other stuff
- Check out [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) - an open source project that you can leverage to decipher all those base64 and ROT13 strings (if you don't know what these are, don't worry, you'll soon find out). 
- Don't know what all of those technical terms mean? Just go to https://isc.sans.edu/glossary.html, where you'll find answers to all (or most) of your questions. 
- Bored of getting all those target ads? Want to mislead the advertisers? You can fight back with Mozillas [Track This!](https://trackthis.link/) project.
